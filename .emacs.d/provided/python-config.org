* Python Emacs configuration

  Here are the Python configurations for emacs. We are going to use
  [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]] for python as it seems to be a straightforward and pretty
  complete setup :).


  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package elpy
      :ensure t
      :init
      (progn
        (elpy-enable)))
  #+END_SRC
